# Customer Segmentation Project

Hi everyone 👋  
This is my internship project under Algonive company.  
In this project I worked on customer segmentation using Python.

---

## Project Overview

The main aim of this project is to divide customers into different groups based on their behavior and spending habits.  
I used the marketing_campaign.csv dataset and performed KMeans clustering to find similar types of customers.

## Steps I Did

1. Loaded and cleaned the data  
2. Scaled the values using StandardScaler  
3. Found the best number of clusters using the Elbow Method  
4. Applied KMeans Clustering  
5. Visualized the clusters using Matplotlib and PCA

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Numpy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn

## Files in My Project

- `customer_segmentation.py` → main python code  
- `marketing_campaign.csv` → dataset used  
- `elbow_method.png` → elbow graph  
- `cluster_visualization.png` → cluster plot  
- `clustered_customers.csv` → final results file  
- `README.md` → this file

## Result

After applying KMeans, I got 4 clusters.  
It helped to understand different types of customers like high spenders, low spenders, and medium category.
